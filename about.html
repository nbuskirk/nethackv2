<p><H1>About Nethack..</h1></p>
<p>Nethack is a canvas-based, html5 demonstration for a role-playing game experience across all current web platforms. It is still in a very early primitive development and planning phase with no real art direction or gameplay niches yet. It will be continuously updated and supported in the weeks ahead. Nethack is written with the help of the crafty JS engine.</p>
<p>Nethack will evolve over time, and become a deep single-player sandbox RPG experience. Branching storylines, dynamic talent trees and combat, all in the vein of an 8-bit retro package :)</p><br/>
<p>Currently working:</p>
<p>* NEW - Spacebar cast fireball</p>
<p>* NEW - Arrow Keys added to controls</p>
<p>* NEW - Potions added to monsters loot table</p>
<p>* NEW - Player sprites replaced temporarily again</p>
<p>* NEW - Collision reworked, monsters are solid and impassable, knocks player away</p>
<p>* WASD character movement</p>
<p>* Static, curated level design</p>
<p>* Random monster placement within the curated level</p>
<p>* Rudimentary collision detection (32x32, squared)</p>
<p>* Death animations and explosions</p>
<p>* Simple life interface - temporary</p>
<p>* Randomized item drops - potions only so far</p><br/>
